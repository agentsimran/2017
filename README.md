# MATH 210 Introduction to Mathematical Computing

MATH 210 at the [University of British Columbia](http://www.math.ubc.ca) is an introduction to scientific computing in Python. We will start with basic Python programming including datatypes, logical statements, loops and functions and then focus on the scientific computing packages NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and pandas. We will use these packages to solve problems in calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, statistics and data visualization.
